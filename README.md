# Assignment 3: Safe Landing Zone

Implementation of an image processing algorithm that helps a drone
to identify safe landing zones.

## Getting Started

Just run "Question1.py" and when the program asks for train and test images, you just put they adresses on it

### Prerequisites

External modules used:
 - Numpy
 - OpenCV2

### Results

Precision: 0.57%

F-Measure Safe: 0.58%

F-Measure Unsafe: 0.82%

The program took 0 hours, 3 minutes and 43 seconds to finish the classification
